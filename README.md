nanobiowave systems is a future startup in stealth mode, architecting extremely advanced technology 

IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS "hardware and software" platforms and application developer ecosystems to 

implement nanobiowave Sportwear with unprecedented and highly disruptive innovation to measure 

"Medical Biochemistry" and realize a consumer virtual reality ecosystem on Android, Apple, Micosoft, 

and other embedded mobile operating systems. nanobiowave systems is architecting a "Medical Biochemistry" 

biosensor array fabric platform ecosystem embedded within nanobiowave Sportwear, an athletic performance, 

nutritional intelligence, virtual human physiology cloud, and emerging personal mobile health analytics 

intelligent platform market sector. nanobiowave is developing a Statement of Work (SOW) for nanobiowave systems 

Automated Cloud Infrastructure. nanobiowave is currently Performing "Reference Design" Platform and 

Systems Architecture and Functional Specifications for the nanobiowave systems Automated Cloud Infrastructure 

and the nanobiowave Human Waveform Systems Architecture with Medical Physiology and 

Medical Biochemistry Nanobiosensor Elements and Fabrics Technology Libraries. nanobiowave systems

is architecting extremely advanced "Medical Biochemistry" nanobiowave Sportwear platforms to implement 

advanced nutritional intelligence capabilities and establish the next generation of mobile telecom platform capabilities. 

nanobiowave intelligent Sportwear implements nanobiosensor fabrics re-configurable to medical physiology 

specialties and complete with an application developer ecosystem. nanobiowave systems is architecting 

advanced cloud-based, consumer-friendly mobile health analytics nanobiowave Sportwear to revolutionize 

market sectors with next generation mobile health and athletics sportwear platforms integrated to next 

generation telecom and data center IaaS/PaaS infrastructures, regionally and globally.

The nanobiowave Doctrine of transdermal medical physiology and 

medical biochemistry imaging human waveform biosensor fabric 

communications infrastructure plan establishes municipal, state,

and federal requirements to develop and deploy consumer-wearable 

transdermal medical physiology and medical biochemistry imaging 

human waveform biosensor fabric realtime health intelligence sportswear 

and the associated access and data center communications infrastructure 
(e.g. 5G Wireless, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11 , DOCSIS 4.0, 

XGPON FTTH, etc) to implement maximum industrial automation of the 

Healthcare industry using realtime communications access platforms and the

nanobiowave Health Intelligence Sportswear, 

nanobiowave HEALTHSTATION Platform, and 

nanobiowave scalable Cloud Infrastructure IaaS/PaaS/SaaS infrastructure.
